 * \brief <b>**Deprecated**</b> Protocol translator client for API v1.
 * \deprecated The protocol translator API v1 is deprecated. The API will exist until end of 2019.
 *
 * The protocol translator is used for bridging the non-LwM2M endpoint devices with the help of Edge
 * to Pelion Cloud.
 *
 * The protocol translator client start function is defined in this header. It is the main entry point
 * to initiate the communication between the protocol translator and Edge. It starts up the
 * event loop and keeps it running. The `pt_client_start()` function does not return until the event loop is
 * shut down.

 *     return 0;
 * }
 * ~~~
 *
 * The API functions define the success and failure callback handlers that are called from an internal event
 * loop. Therefore, make sure that the operations in the callbacks do not block the event loop. All API functions
 * must have the `connection` as first argument. This is the connection to write the requests. Callbacks will have
 * an `userdata` argument, which is the application user data set in the protocol translator API calls.
 * Blocking the event loop blocks the protocol translator and it cannot continue until the control is given back to
 * the event loop from customer callbacks. If there is a long running operation for the responses in the callback
 * handlers, you should move that into a thread.
 *
 * An example of registering the protocol translator with the customer callbacks:
 * ~~~
 *
 * struct user_context
 * {
 *   char *data;
 * };
 *
 * static void registration_success(void *userdata)
 * {
 *    printf("Protocol translator registration successful.\n");
 *    struct user_context *user_context = (struct user_context*) userdata;
 *    // work with the user_context->data
 * }
 *
 * static void registration_failure(void *userdata)
 * {
 *   printf("Protocol translator registration failed.\n");
 *   struct user_context *user_context = (struct user_context*) userdata;
 *   free(user_context->data);
 *   free(user_context);
 * }
 *
 * static void device_registered_successfully(const char* device_id, void *userdata)
 * {
 *    //device_id would be 'test-device'
 *    // work with the userdata
 * }
 *
 * static void device_register_failed(const char* device_id, void *userdata)
 * {
 *    //device_id would be 'test-device'
 *    // work with the userdata
 * }
 *
 * struct user_context *user_context = malloc(sizeof(struct user_context));
 * user_context->data = "Data...";
 * pt_register_protocol_translator(connection, registration_success, registration_failure, user_context);
 *
 * pt_device_t device = pt_create_device(strdup("test-device")...);
 *
 * pt_register_device(connection, device, device_registered_successfully,
 *      device_register_failed, user_context);
 *
 * ~~~
 *
 * Refer to `pt-client/client_example.c` for the example use of full protocol translator API.

 * \brief Callback function prototype for the device resource specific action on #OPERATION_WRITE or #OPERATION_EXECUTE.
 * \deprecated The protocol translator API v1 is deprecated. The API will exist until end of 2019.
 *
 * Note the value size for integers and floats which are received from Edge Core.
 * This differs from the case when the protocol translator writes the value to Edge Core
 * where it is allowed to write different size binary values. When the write is coming from
 * Device Management to Edge Core the value representation is `text-format`. Device Management Client
 * does not store the original binary value and the original value size is lost. The interpretation
 * of the value must be implemented in the callback function.
 *
 * \param resource The resource that the action was triggered on.
 * \param value A pointer to the value buffer.\n
 *        The ownership of the value buffer is within the `pt_resource_t`.
 *        For different LwM2M data types there are byte-order restrictions as follows:\n
 *        \li \b String: UTF-8.
 *        \li \b Integer: A binary signed integer in network byte-order (64 bits).
 *        \li \b Float: IEEE 754-2008 floating point value in network byte-order (64 bits).
 *        \li \b Boolean: An 8 bit unsigned integer with value 0 or 1.
 *        \li \b Opaque: The sequence of binary data.
 *        \li \b Time: Same representation as integer.
 *        \li \b Objlnk: Two 16 bit unsigned integers one beside the other. The first one is the Object ID and the
 * second is the Object Instance ID.\n Refer to: OMA Lightweight Machine to Machine Technical Specification for data
 * type specifications. \param size The size of the value to write. \param userdata The user-supplied context.
