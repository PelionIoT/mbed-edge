 * \file pt-client-2/pt_api.h
 * \brief Protocol translator external API V2.
 *
 * The protocol translator is used for bridging the non-LwM2M endpoint devices with the help of Device Management Edge
 * to Device Management.
 *
 * The protocol translator client start function is defined in this header. It is the main entry point
 * to initiate the communication between the protocol translator and Device Management Edge. It starts up the
 * event loop and keeps it running. The `pt_client_start()` function does not return until the event loop is
 * shut down.
 *
 * The API functions define the success and failure callback handlers that are called from an internal event
 * loop. Therefore, make sure that the operations in the callbacks do not block the event loop. All API functions
 * must have the `connection_id` as first argument. This specifies the connection to write the requests. Callbacks will
 * have a `userdata` argument, which is the user data that the application set in the protocol translator API calls.
 * Blocking the event loop blocks the protocol translator and it cannot continue until the control is given back to the
 * event loop from the customer callbacks. If there is a long running operation for the responses in the callback
 * handlers, you should move that into another thread.
 *
 * An example of registering the protocol translator with the customer callbacks:
 *

/**
 * \brief Callback function prototype for the device resource specific action on #OPERATION_WRITE or #OPERATION_EXECUTE.
 *
 * Note the value size for integers and floats which are received from Device Management Edge.
 * This differs from the case when the protocol translator writes the value to Device Management Edge,
 * where it is allowed to write different size binary values. When the write is coming from
 * Device Management to Device Management Edge the value representation is `text-format`. Device Management Client
 * does not store the original binary value and the original value size is lost. The interpretation
 * of the value must be implemented in the callback function.
 *
 * \param[in] connection_id The ID of the connection of the requesting application.
 * \param[in] device_id The device ID targetted for this callback.
 * \param[in] object_id The object ID targetted.
 * \param[in] object_instance_id The object instance ID targetted.
 * \param[in] resource_id The resource ID targetted.
 * \param[in] operation The operation, for example OPERATION_WRITE.
 * \param[in] value A pointer to the value buffer.\n
 *            The ownership of the value buffer is within the `pt_resource_t` and the pointer is only valid for the
 *            duration of the function call.
 *            For different LwM2M data types there are byte-order restrictions as follows:\n
 *            \li \b String: UTF-8.
 *            \li \b Integer: A binary signed integer in network byte-order (64 bits).
 *            \li \b Float: IEEE 754-2008 floating point value in network byte-order (64 bits).
 *            \li \b Boolean: An 8 bit unsigned integer with value 0 or 1.
 *            \li \b Opaque: The sequence of binary data.
 *            \li \b Time: Same representation as integer.
 *            \li \b Objlnk: Two 16 bit unsigned integers one beside the other. The first one is the Object ID and the
 * second is the Object Instance ID.\n Refer to: OMA Lightweight Machine to Machine Technical Specification for data
 * type specifications.
 * \param[in] size The size of the value to write.
 * \param[in] userdata The user-supplied context.
 *
 * \return Result of the resource callback function, should return `PT_STATUS_SUCCESS` when the operation was
 * successful, see ::pt_status_t for possible error codes.

/**
 * \brief Adds a resource to a device with a callback.
 *
 * This function creates a resource with allowed operations specified by \p operations.
 * The callback is set for the write and execute actions and are triggered when

 *
 * \param[in] connection_id The ID of the connection of the requesting application.
 * \param[in] device_id The device ID to which to add the resource.
 * \param[in] object_id The object ID to which to add the resource.
 * \param[in] object_instance_id The object instance ID to which to add the resource.
 * \param[in] resource_id The resource ID for the added resource.
 * \param[in] resource_name The optional resource name for the added resource.
 * \param[in] type The resource type.
 * \param[in] operations The operations this resource will allow.\n
 *                       For example, GET/#OPERATION_READ and PUT/#OPERATION_WRITE. The value is a bit field of
 *                       allowed operations.\n
 *                       \li If #OPERATION_WRITE is set to flags, the parameter for \p callback must be populated.
 *                       \li If #OPERATION_EXECUTE is set to flags, the parameter for \p callback must be populated.\n
 *                       Now, you can have a combination of #OPERATION_EXECUTE and #OPERATION_WRITE for the resource.
 *
 * \note Note the difference when writing a value from the protocol translator to Device Management Edge opposed
 * to receiving a write from Device Management Edge. It is allowed to write different sized binary
 * integers and float towards Device Management Edge. On the other hand, when receiving a write from
 * Device Management Edge, the integer or float value is always 64 bit.
