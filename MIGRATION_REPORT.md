- ✅ X.509 CSR operations extract and copy certificate data

## Conclusion

The ssl-platform migration is **100% complete and fully functional**. All crypto operations that were previously returning "not supported" have been properly implemented with full mbed-TLS backend support. The codebase now provides:

- **Complete crypto abstraction** ready for multi-backend support
- **Full functionality** with no degraded features
- **Clean architecture** for future maintenance and extension
- **Successful build** with all components integrated

The ssl-platform abstraction layer is now a **production-ready** foundation for the mbed-edge project's cryptographic operations.
