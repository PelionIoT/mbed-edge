* Allow LwM2M resources to be optionally named by Protocol Translators and Gateway Resource Managers.
* Updated the design of subdevice (devices behind the gateway) firmware update feature. Edge core will now parse and also validate the firmware update manifest intended for the subdevice. It will then forward the manifest's vendorID and classID to PT for validation before downloading the update image.
   * `manifest_vendor_and_class` allows PT to receive the vendorID and classID provided in the update manifest.
* Update libcurl to version 7.75 (in `lib/pal-platform.json`) to fix multiple CVEs.
    * BDSA-2020-3058

* Updated libwebsockets library to v3.1.

### Known issues

 * When Edge communicates on behalf of multiple devices, there is an underlying limitation in the CoAP communication. This limitation effectively reduces the number of requests in flight to one. When there is very heavy communication, this introduces extra latency. An example calculation:
   * 30 mediated devices with a resource tree of 20 resources.
   * 200ms round trip time to Device Management.
   * 10KB registration message.
   * Underlying Device Management Client sends data in 1KB blocks and waits for an acknowledgement for each block. This equals 10 * 200ms = 2 seconds.
   * During this time, Edge does not process other messages.
 * If Edge passes a lot of notification updates to Device Management, the responsiveness to requests initiated by Device Management may be hindered.

### Limitations
 * Mediated device lifetime tracking is not supported. Devices have the same lifetime as the Edge device. The default is one hour. The `#define` parameter used to change the lifetime is `MBED_CLOUD_CLIENT_LIFETIME`.
 * `DELETE` (CoAP/LwM2M) operation not supported.
 * Devices moving between Edge instances have corner cases that are not supported. Deregister the devices from the current Edge instance before connecting to another Edge instance.

### Best practices
 * Protocol translators (PT) should register endpoints with unique names. The names should be idempotent meaning that the name of the device remains same even when its re-onboarded or a new session is established with the device. One way to derive this name could be to use the device's mac address which is suppose to be unique.
 * In scenarios where multiple protocol translators can derive the same name of 2 different physical or virtual devices then add an identifier to it in order to make it unique. For example, by adding a prefix or suffix based on the protocol translator name, which must be unique.

## Release 0.15.0 (2021-1-12)

* Migrated domains from ArmMbed to PelionIoT.
* Updated to Pelion Device Management Client (PDMC) library version 4.7.0.
* Updated Mbed TLS to version 2.22.0 in previous release.
* Edge Core now supports the new Firmware-Over-the-Air (FOTA) Update Framework library introduced by Device Management Client 4.7.0.

    * To enable the FOTA library, compile Edge Core with the CMake `-DFOTA_ENABLE=ON` and `-DFIRMWARE_UPDATE=ON` flags. Otherwise, Edge Core compiles with Update client hub.
    * The FOTA Update Framework library does not support the Subdevice FOTA feature. To use this feature, compile Edge Core with Update client hub.
    * By default, the FOTA Update Framework library is statically linked with `libcurl` version 7.72.0. To dynamically link the curl library provide CMake `-DMBED_CLOUD_CLIENT_CURL_DYNAMIC_LINK=ON` flag.
    * The FOTA callback function is defined in `./fota` directory. This functions invokes a bash script, which the function expects to be located at `/opt/pelion/fota_update_activate.sh`.

* Validated the use of manifest-tool version 2.1.0 and updated the instructions in the Readme file to use the `manifest-dev-tool` tool to generate a developer update certificate.

## Release 0.14.0 (2020-12-07)

* Added Gateway Resource Manager (GRM) [JSON Remote Procedure Call (RPC)](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) APIs. These APIS allow system management services on the gateway to register and add new LwM2M objects under gateway resources.
   * `gw_resource_manager_register` to register a system management service.
   * `add_resource` to add an LwM2M object to the list of existing gateway resources.
   * `write_resource_value` to update resource values.
   * `write` allows the resource manager to react to messages sent by Edge. Currently, the gateway resource manager should react to write requests with an `execute` or a `write` operation.
* Removed the multi-instance LwM2M object with ID `/33457`. It reported the default capabilities of Edge such as terminal, logs, statistics and alerts but never managed those services. Maestro is responsible for the orchestration and configuration of the gateway services. It uses the JSON RPC APIs to register itself as a gateway resource manager and add an instance of LwM2M object with ID `/33457` upon detecting gateway features such as terminal, logs, remote configuration and KaaS.

Maestro manages the orchestration and configuration of the gateway services. Maestro uses the JSON RPC APIs to register itself as a gateway resource manager and add an instance of a LwM2M object with ID `/33457` when it detects gateway features such as terminal, logs, remote configuration and Kubernetes as a Service (KaaS).
* Added a JS example (`simple-grm-example.js`) in the mbed-edge-examples project to demonstrate how to use GRM feature.
* Added support for [Parsec](https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/index.html). To compile Edge Core with Parsec, set the `-DPARSEC_TPM_SE_SUPPORT=ON` CMake flag. In this configuration, the secure connection with Pelion is established using a device bootstrap private key generated on the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). We have tested integration with:
   * IBM's Software TPM. To test Edge Core with the software TPM, follow the [instructions provided by Parsec](https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_service/tests/index.html#testing-the-tpm-provider-using-the-software-tpm).
   * Hardware TPM v2 of Dell Edge Gateway 3002.
* Added support for firmware update of devices behind the gateway managed by the Protocol Translators (PTs). PTs can use the new JSON RPC APIs to prompt Edge Core to download a firmware update image and provide the update status to Pelion Device Management.
   * `download_asset` - The PT verifies the manifest received on LwM2M object `10252`, and uses the JSON RPC APIs to prompt Edge Core to download the firmware image. After Edge Core downloads the image successfully, it responds with the file path of the image.
   * `subdevice_manifest_status` - The PT provides the status of the parsed manifest to Edge Core.
* Updated the C example (`pt-example`) in the mbed-edge-examples project to demonstrate the firmware update process for devices behind the gateway.

 * If Edge passes a lot of notification updates to Device Management, the responsiveness to requests initiated by Device Management may be hindered.
 * Protocol translators (PT) may cause side effects on devices connecting through another protocol translator. Edge Core identifies endpoint devices by their name. To prevent unknown behavior caused by clashing names, ensure the devices have unique names across the PTs. For example, add a prefix or suffix based on the protocol translator name, which must be unique.
 * `DELETE` (CoAP/LwM2M) operation not supported.
 * Devices moving between Edge instances have corner cases that are not supported. Deregister the devices from the current Edge instance before connecting to another Edge instance.

## Release 0.13.0 (2020-05-15)

* The default value of `max-age` is set to 60. This allows caching of the resource value in Pelion Device Management for up to 60 seconds.
* Added a new gateway resource with LwM2M object ID `/33457`. The rich nodes can report the features supported on the platform. Users can enable, disable and remotely configure the feature. It statically reports terminal, logs, statistics and alerts.

## Release 0.12.0 (2020-02-07)

* Pelion Device Management Client library updated to version 4.3.0.
* Mbed TLS updated to version 2.19.1.

## Release 0.11.0 (2019-10-03)

* Pelion Device Management Client library updated to version 3.4.0.
* Mbed TLS updated to version 2.18.1.

## Release 0.10.0 (2019-05-07)

 * Changed Edge to use Device Management Client library default TLS configuration file instead of the TLS configuration file provided by Edge.
   * Removed the now obsolete TLS configuration file (`/config/mbedtls_mbed_client_config.h`).
 * Added KCM certificate `GET` and KCM public key `GET` C APIs.
 * Updated Device Management Client to version 3.3.0.
 * New KCM crypto JSON RPC APIs:
   * `crypto_generate_random` API to generate a random buffer using KCM API.
   * `crypto_asymmetric_sign` API to perform asymmetric sign operation using KCM API.
   * `crypto_asymmetric_verify` API to perform asymmetric verify operation using KCM API.
   * `crypto_ecdh_key_agreement` API to perform ECDH key agreement using KCM API.
 * New KCM crypto PT C APIs:
   * `pt_crypto_generate_random` API to generate a random buffer using KCM API.
   * `pt_crypto_asymmetric_sign` API to perform asymmetric sign operation using KCM API.
   * `pt_crypto_asymmetric_verify` API to perform asymmetric verify operation using KCM API.
   * `pt_crypto_ecdh_key_agreement` API to perform ECDH key agreement operation using KCM API.
 * Changed protocol translator client execute handling to send response through event. This allows sending an execute response payload by setting and writing the resource value inside the execute callback.
 * Added new device certificate renewal PT C APIs to perform certificate renewal or certificate enrollment using CA in cloud:
   * `pt_device_certificate_renew` API to initiate a certificate renewal or enrollment.
   * `pt_free_certificate_chain_context` API to free a certificate chain context passed to the `pt_device_certificate_renew_response_handler`.
   * `pt_device_certificate_renew_finish` API to finish a device certificate renewal or enrollment.
   * `pt_device_certificate_renew_response_handler` callback API prototype for handling the certificate renewal or enrollment result.
   * `pt_device_certificate_renew_request_handler` callback API prototype for handling the certificate renewal or enrollment request sent from the Cloud.

### Bugfixes

 * Added NULL-checks for connection in various API calls. These prevent potential segfaults in situations where connection is missing.
 * Fixed integer request ids in JSON RPC requests.

## Release 0.9.0 (2019-04-19)

 * Added handling for pending JSON RPC requests. Requests are cleaned with an error response if the client
   doesn't respond within the maximum time limit. You can configure this timeout in `cmake/edge_configure.cmake` by modifying
   values `SERVER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD_MS` for Edge Core and `CLIENT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD_MS` for protocol
   translator C-API v2 client. The entity that made the request receives a `PT_API_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` error response.
 * Added handling for pending JSON RPC requests in the case of disconnection. The entity that made the request receives a `PT_API_REMOTE_DISCONNECTED` error response.
 * Mbed TLS updated to version 2.17.0.
 * Added certificate renewal JSON RPC and C-APIs.
 * Added KCM certificate `get` and KCM public key `get` JSON RPC APIs.
 * Fixed the decoding buffer size in our Base64 library.

### Bugfixes

 * Added test that client sets the disconnect callback in `pt_client_create` in the v2 API.

## Release 0.8.0 (2019-02-27)

 * Updated Mbed TLS to version 2.15.1.
 * Added end-to-end support for asynchronous write operations (`OPERATION_WRITE` and `OPERATION_EXECUTE`) from a web application
   to protocol translator managed endpoints.
   * This allows the web application to detect if the operation has succeeded or failed.
 * CMake 3.5 is required
 * Fixed an issue where a write value operation would allow creating more endpoints than the configured endpoint limit.
 * Fixed a crash occurring when a write value operation is called while the protocol translator is disconnected.
 * Updated Device Management Client to version 2.2.1

## Release 0.7.1 (2019-01-08)

 * Removed `Mbed` from documentation.
 * Removed obsolete injection of insecure RoT module in Edge Core build.
 * Moved the `include/jsonrpc/jsonrpc.h` header under `lib/jsonrpc/jsonrpc`. This header is internal.
 * Moved the `include/edge-rpc/rpc.h` header under `edge-rpc/edge-rpc`. This header is internal.
 * Implemented sending the device unregistration message to Device Management backend. The unregistration relies on the lifetime expiration in the Device Management backend.
 * Updated Device Management Client to version 2.1.1.
 * Implemented Protocol Translator API v2.
   * The old Protocol Translator API (v1) is still available.
   * The v2 API has better thread safety than the v1 API.
   * `ns_list.h` is not visible outside.
   * API uses a connection ID instead of a connection structure pointer.
   * The v2 API optimizes the size of the payload in communication with Device Management Edge.
 * **Deprecated** The Protocol Translator API v1. The API headers deprecated are under `include/pt-client`.
 * Removed Yocto toolchain and target. The build environments need to provide a correct toolchain and target.

### Bugfixes

 * Fixed usage for `--cbor-conf` also when combined with `--reset-storage`.
 * Fixed possible invalid pointer dereference when calling `pt_client_final_cleanup` after `pt_client_start` has returned.
   *Migration note:* The `pt_client_final_cleanup` API functionality has been moved inside the `pt_client_start` function and the `pt_client_final_cleanup` function has been deprecated. Any call to `pt_client_final_cleanup` should be removed and the `pt-client/client.h`" include should be removed from the protocol translator as it is an internal header.
 * Fixed memory leak on `PUT` and `WRITE` request handling. The payload pointer given from Cloud Client to Edge was never freed. The payload was copied for NUL-termination and the original pointer was not freed.
 * Added workaround for waiting Cloud Client threads to stop on Edge Core close. The underlying Cloud Client's EventOS event loop thread is not joined and occasionally it is reported as memory leak by Valgrind.

### Known issues

 * Firmware update from `morty` version of Yocto to `sumo` does not work and makes devices unusable. The differences in the device trees of the different versions cause problems when starting the kernel after the update.
 * When Edge communicates on behalf of multiple devices, there is an underlying limitation in the CoAP communication that effectively reduces the amount of requests in flight to be one. On very heavy communication cases, this introduces extra latency. An example calculation:
   * 30 mediated devices with a resource tree of 20 resources.
   * Round trip time to Mbed Cloud of 200 ms.
   * 10 KB registration message.
   * Underlying Cloud Client sends data in 1 KB blocks and waits for acknowledgement for each block. This equals 10 * 200 ms = 2 seconds.
   * During that time, other messages are not processed.
 * If there are a lot of notification updates passed to Mbed Cloud from Mbed Edge, the responsiveness to requests initiated by Mbed Cloud may be hindered.
 * Protocol translators may cause side effects on devices connecting through another protocol translator if both protocol translators use the same names for the devices because Edge Core identifies the endpoint devices by their name. There is limited checking on which protocol translator owns the endpoint device, and clashing names can cause unknown behavior. Ensure that devices have unique names across the protocol translators. For example, add a prefix or suffix based on the protocol translator name, which must be unique.
 * `DELETE` (CoAP/LwM2M) operation not supported.
 * Devices moving between Edge instances have corner cases that are not supported. Deregister the devices from the current Edge instance before connecting to another Edge instance.
 * Mediated device lifetime tracking is not supported. Devices have the same lifetime as the Edge device. Default is 1 hour. The `#define` used to change the lifetime is `MBED_CLOUD_CLIENT_LIFETIME`.

## Release 0.6.0 (2018-10-19)

 * WISE-3160 content removed.
 * Device Management Edge Local Management API introduced.
 * New command line argument for Edge Core.
   * It is now possible to control the log coloring using the `--color-log` argument.
   * Without the argument, a plain text log is produced.
   * When giving the argument `--color-log` to `edge-core` binary, an ANSI colored log is produced.
 * Added support for setting user data to the `pt_device_t` structure. See `pt_create_device_with_userdata` in
   `pt_api.h.`
 * Removed the duplicate configuration file of Device Management Client.
   * `mbed_client_user_config.h` removed.
   * Moved the TCP keepalive configuration to `mbed_cloud_client_user_config.h`.

 * Added new fields `account-id` and `lwm2m-server-uri` to Edge status REST API.

### Bugfixes

 * Removed the protocol translator examples from the `edge-core` repository.
   * The examples are now in the [Mbed Edge protocol translator examples repository](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-edge-examples).
 * Added the `libevent_global_shutdown` function to the cleanup stage to prevent occasional memory leaks during shutdown.
 * Fixed issues in JSONRPC message handling on broken messages.

### Known issues

Firmware update from `morty` version of Yocto to `sumo` does not work and makes devices unusable. The differences in the device trees of different versions cause problems when starting the kernel after the update.

## Release 0.5.2 (2018-08-31)

### Bugfixes

 * Implemented fragmented JSONRPC message handling. There was no check if message was fragmented. Fragmentation happened when request payload was exceeding 2048 bytes.

## Release 0.5.1 (2018-07-25)

 * Added CBOR configuration file injection mechanism for `BYOC_MODE`.
   The configuration is injected with `--cbor-conf` command line argument in `edge-core`.
 * Moved `read_file.[c|h]` from `pt-example` to `common`.
 * Added Mbed Cloud developer credentials C source file conversion to CBOR support to `edge-tool`.

 * Prevent enabling the developer update resources if the developer mode is not enabled

## Release 0.5.0 (2018-06-26)

 * Update Mbed Cloud Client to `1.3.3`.
 * **Breaking change** Revised the build system to support normal CMake cycle.
   * Removed pre-generated `build`-directory. Normal out of tree builds are now
     supported.
   * Build helper script `build_mbed_edge.sh` removed.
   * Added `cmake`-directory for predefined CMake configurations.
   * Added `cmake/targets`-directory for predefined build targets.
   * Added `cmake/toolchains`-directory for predefined build toolchains.
 * **Breaking change** Changed underlying communication channel between the Edge Core and protocol translators to use Unix domain socket instead of TCP socket.
 * **Breaking API change** Removed host and port parameters from `pt_client_start()` function and replaced with `socket_path`.
   The underlying communication channel is changed to Unix domain socket.
 * Released JSONRPC API documentation for protocol translators to use.
   The new API is a JSONRPC 2.0 API and uses a websocket as transport.
 * Added simple Javascript protocol translator example to `examples/simple-js-example`.
 * Added `jansson` and `libevent` to libraries.
   Removed runtime and compilation time dependency from environment and operating system.
   These are now built and linked into Mbed Edge binaries in the project.
 * Added `libwebsocket` and `mbedtls` to libraries.
   These are now built and linked into Mbed Edge binaries in the project.
 * Removed `mbed_edge_config.h` from `WISE-3610-SDK` in favor of CMake configuration
   options.
 * Fixed the file path in the documentation for the `update_default_resources.c`.
   Correct folder for the file is `config`.
 * Fix the version information printed by edge-core in product repository.
 * WISE-3610 SDK 1.0.19e support.
 * Improve performance when a lot of endpoints are used.
 * Edge Core check the JSONRPC Protocol API version of Edge Client. If the version doesn't match
   the connection is closed.
 * Implemented a common Trace API which all Edge components use.
 * Removed `common/edge_common.[c|h]`.
 * Changed default for maximum number of registered endpoints limit. New default value is 500.

### Bugfixes

 * Fixed a bug where Edge Core did't decrease the number of allocated endpoints if the Protocol API client was killed.
 * Fixed leaks in edge-core shutdown.
 * Fixed a bug where objects were added twice to Mbed Cloud Client.
 * Fixed a bug when Edge Core could not start when the --reset-storage parameter was used.
 * Fixed Edge Core to return `Edge Core is shutting down` instead of `Internal error` when Edge Core is closing
 * Fixed Edge Core to return `Invalid params` instead of `Error` if deviceId is invalid.
 * Fixed Edge Core crash when it cannot allocate the http port.
 * Fixed registration update behaviour to set the flag to false if resources were added or removed in correct order. The issue was that flag was set to false first and in a nested function call set back to true. This caused unnecessary empty registration updates to Mbed Cloud.

### Known issues

 * Mbed Edge communicates on behalf of multiple devices. There is a underlying limitation
   in the CoAP communication to effectively reduce the amount of requests in flight to
   be one. On very heavy communication cases this will introduce extra latency.
   An example calculation:

   There is limited checking on the actual protocol translator which owns the
   translated device specified by the name. Ensure that devices have unique names

   protocol translator name which must be unique.
 * `DELETE` (CoAP/LWM2M) operation not supported.
 * Devices moving between Mbed Edge instances have corner cases that are not supported.
   You should de-register the devices from the current Mbed Edge before connecting to
   an another Mbed Edge.
 * Mediated device lifetime tracking not supported. Devices will have the same lifetime
   as the Mbed Edge device. Default is 1 hour.
   The `#define` to change the lifetime is `MBED_CLOUD_CLIENT_LIFETIME`.
 * Device unregistration to Mbed Cloud uses only the lifetame expiration mechanism.

## Release 0.4.5 (2018-05-04)

 * Updated Mbed Cloud Client version to 1.3.1.1. Which contains following fixes.
   * Linux :RPi3 device gets stuck when rebooting the system after performing firmware
     update.
   * Linux: Update client fix for handling callbacks properly.
   * POST response handling to send the final response only once.

## Release R0.4.4 (2018-04-04)

 * WISE-3610 compilation warnings fixes.
 * Doxygen documentation formatting fixes.
 * Contribution instructions and pull request template added for GitHub community.

### Bugfixes

 * Corrected registration update messages. They were always populated with the
   translated endpoints. This caused a full registration in the Mbed Cloud for
   the translated endpoints. The full registration deletes all subscriptions to
   the endpoints resources. The functionality is now registration update which
   refreshes only the translated device lifetime.

## Release R0.4.3 (2018-03-23)

 * [Mbed Edge Yocto meta layer](https://github.com/ARMmbed/meta-mbed-edge) released.
 * [Mbed RaspberryPi3 Yocto meta layer](https://github.com/ARMmbed/meta-mbed-raspberrypi) released.
 * `protocol_api.c` - fix misleading debug print - `Create resource /d` was printed but actually we were doing a value update.
 * Documented the `lifetime` parameter in `pt_create_device` of `pt-client` API to clearly
   mark the parameter to be reserved and unused.
 * Change default logging level to INFO.

## Known issues

See the release CR-0.4.2 known issue list.

## Release CR-0.4.2 (2018-03-16)

 * Ignore CoAP parse errors from mbed Cloud Client as they are non-critical.
 * Added API's for setting execute and value update callbacks to edge resources.
 * Changed byte order helper functions to use correct conversion functions in `pt-example/byte_order.c`.
 * Add separate configuration header for Mbed Client.

 * Protocol translators may cause side-effect on devices connecting through another
   protocol translator if both protocol translators use same names for the devices.
   There is limited checking on the actual protocol translator which owns the
   translated device specified by the name. Ensure that devices have unique names
   across the protocol translators, as an example add a prefix or suffix based on the
   protocol translator name which must be unique.
 * `DELETE` (CoAP/LWM2M) operation not supported.
 * Devices moving between Mbed Edge instances have corner cases that are not supported.
   You should de-register the devices from the current Mbed Edge before connecting to
   an another Mbed Edge.
 * Mediated device lifetime tracking not supported. Devices will have the same lifetime
   as the Mbed Edge device. Default is 1 hour.
   The `#define` to change the lifetime is `MBED_CLOUD_CLIENT_LIFETIME`
 * Device unregistration to Mbed Cloud uses only expiration mechanism currently.
 * Protocol translated device registration through Mbed Edge to Mbed Cloud initiates
   register update message to Mbed Cloud. Mbed Cloud handles the mediated device update
   as full registration. This causes current subscriptions to be dropped to for protocol
   translated resources. Application logic must listen to registration notifications
   and renew subscriptions.

### Bugfixes

 * Add support for empty payload for POST requests from cloud to Edge endpoint.

## Release CR-0.4.1 (2018-03-09)

 * **Backwards incompatible** Root of Trust key derivation fix.
   If the backwards compatibility is needed a define a compiler flag
   `PAL_DEVICE_KEY_DERIVATION_BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY_CALC` to value of `1`.
 * Update Mbed Cloud Client to `R1.3.0` release with the dependencies.
   It adds secure time support.
 * Added 3rd party contribution instructions.
 * Added configuration samples and files required by the update feature to the WISE-3610
 * Fixed the file path in the documentation for the `update_default_resources.c`.
   Correct folder for the file is `edge-client`
 * Added configuration samples and files required by the update featur to the WISE-3610.
 * Remove the define `MBED_CLOUD_CLIENT_CONFIG_DIR`. Use `PAL_FS_MOUNT_POINT_PRIMARY`
   and `PAL_FS_MOUNT_POINT_SECONDARY` instead.
 * Edge-core returns an error when trying to registerer a device which is already
   registered. This helps to prevent accidentially modifying the devices owned by
   another edge-core client process.
   This allows more CoAP messages to be stored for resending and duplicate detection.
 * The `edge-tool` to include full message on errors. The Mbed Cloud SDK in some cases
   wraps the status codes to, e.g. `404` to `400`.
 * Added Software One Time Programmed (SOTP) security feature.

### Protocol Translator API

 * Removed resource values from debug logs. Resource value can be pure binary
   data and can break log consumers. The value size is logged instead.

## Release CR-0.4.0 (2018-02-02)

 * **License changed to Apache 2.0**
 * Changed the Edge Core resource value representation to `text-format`.
   This aligns the representation with Mbed Cloud Client and its expected format
   for resource level values. TLV is not yet supported. The values manipulated from
   the Mbed Cloud are in `text-format`.
   See LWM2M technical specification for exact definition of the data types.
   The link between the Protocol Translator and Edge Core uses binary representation
   of the data.
   When protocol translator writes the data to Edge Core:
   * integer, time, float, boolean: network byte-order.
   * string: utf-8.
   * opaque: sequence of binary data.
   * objlink: two 16 bit unsigned integers beside the other.
   When Edge Core writes the data to protocol translator:
   * integer, time, float: network byte-order. The value is 64 bits.
   * string: utf-8.
   * opaque: sequence of binary data.
   * objlink: two 16 bit unsigned integers beside the other.
 * Added a helper tool `edge-tool` for observing, manipulating and filtering resources.
 * Added graceful shutdown support to Edge Core.
 * Edge Core disconnects if client sends invalid JSON.
 * Protocol API error codes are improved to be more consistent / descriptive.
 * Added update client functionality
 * Added maximum number of registered endpoints limit. Default value 1000.
 * Added support to configure the network interface.
 * Added version information to the status API
 * Added support for Reset Factory Settings. Customers may implement their own implementation for RFS in \
   edge-core/edge_server_customer_code.c
 * Fixed issues found by Coverity analysis tool
 * Protocol translator initiated value write and device_register methods improved on error situations.
   The first JSON error is returned and if JSON errors exist, it will not update.
 * Cloud initiated value write made more robust regarding memory buffer handling.

### Protocol translator API

 * **Breaking API change** Removed all global connection variables to make protocol translator API usable from shared library. Causes all API related functions to expect `struct connection *connection` in the arguments.
 * **Breaking API change** The `pt_client_start` function has output reference parameter `struct connection *connection` added. Applications must provide this to protocol translator API functions as argument. This binds the calls to the specific Edge Core connection.
 * **Breaking API change** All protocol translator API functions expect `struct connection *connection` as first argument.
 * **Breaking API change** All protocol translator callback functions expect `struct connection *connection` as first argument.
 * **Breaking API change** Resource values are expected to be given in network byte-order format
   for certain LWM2M value types:
   * integer, time, float, boolean: network byte-order.
 * **Breaking API change** Changed the return type of `pt_received_write_handler` from
   `void` to `int`. It is now possible to return failure from the protocol translator
   implementation.
 * **Breaking API change** `pt_object_instance_add_resource` signature changed.
   The parameter `uint8_t operations` removed. The function will create only a read-only
   resources to the passed object instance.
 * **New API function** Added function to support creating resources with callback.
   The callback is the specified action to do for the resource on WRITE or EXECUTE operation.
   The function name is `pt_object_instance_add_resource_with_callback` and has two
   differences in the signature over the read-only resource creation, `uint8_t operations` and
   `pt_resource_callback callback` function pointer.
   The signature of the resource callback is `typedef void (*pt_resource_callback)(const pt_resource_opaque_t *resource, const uint8_t *value, const uint32_t size, void* userdata)`.
 * Added `parent`-field for `pt_device_t`, `pt_object_t`, `pt_object_instance_t`
   and `pt_resource_opaque_t`.
 * Added an optional helper API `pt-client/pt_device_object.h` for creation standard LWM2M
   device resource object `/3`.

### Protocol translator example

 * Added defaults to command line arguments. Port and host arguments are optional.
   Connects to `127.0.0.1:22223` by default.
 * Updated the protocol translator example:
   * To use network byte-order for float temperatures.
   * to use the changed API when adding resources to object instances.
   * to use the resource callback directly on the resource.
   * IPSO object example to create `/3` device object for the cpu temperature example device.

### LoRa protocol translator example for WISE-3610

 * Added defaults to command line arguments. Port and host arguments are optional.
   Connects to `127.0.0.1:22223` by default.
 * Updated the LoRa protocol translator example to use the changed protocol translator API
   when adding resources to object instances.

### Bugfixes

 * Fixed issues when message was written to client and response came back before the message
   went to request queue. The application were not able to match the response to any request.
   This also caused hidden memory leak, the messages were not removed because response was
   already handled.

## Release CR-0.3.2 (2017-12-27)

 * Updated the version of the factory configurator client
 * Changed the _network_interface to a string in edge-client
 * Removed invalid assert from pt_device_free

 * Added type definition `protocol_translator_t` for `struct protocol_translator`
 * Splitted `misc_lib.[c|h]` into two reusable functions.
  File `common/integer_length.[c|h]` for calculating integer length as characters.
  File `common/default_message_id_generator.[c|h]` for default implementation of message id generator.
 * Default Mbed Cloud Client Configuration directory is changed from `./pal` to `./mcc_config`. Please read the new instructions in `README.md`.
 * Implemented `POST` and `PUT` support from CoAP to mediated device resources.
   These are translated into `WRITE` and `EXECUTE` operations on LWM2M resources.

### Protocol translator API

 * Introduced new callback (includes device_id) for device related operations
 * **Breaking API change** `pt_client_start` signature changed.
   Removed individual callback function parameters and replaced it with a
   `protocol_translator_callbacks_t` struct to contain all needed callback functions.
 * **Breaking API change** Added a shutdown callback to `pt_client_start` callback structure.
 * **Breaking API change** Added `pt_` namespace to  the callback function prototypes.
 * **Breaking API change** Added `void* userdata` for callback function prototypes.
 * **Breaking API change** Added `hostname` parameter to `pt_client_start`.

### Protocol translator example

 * Updated the example to use the changes in the API's.
 * Protocol translator API moved to run in another thread instead of running in main thread.
 * Devices are contained in list and are persistent during the process runtime.
 * Removed JSON based example application configuration. The JSON file path parameter removed.
